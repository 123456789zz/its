	SCHEDULING THE INSTALLATION OF EQUIPMENT

	It is the scheduler's job to coordinate the deliveries of
machines.  Scheduling is a complex business:  each order for a machine
involves a separate planning operation that starts when the order is
placed, and becomes progressively more detailed as the day of
installation approaches.  Much of the subtlety of the scheduling
process lies in the careful accumulation by the scheduler of
information about each machine to be installed.

	The scheduler must take care not only of installations, but
also of upgrades and cancellations.  In this section we describe only
the procedures associated with the installation of equipment, we did
not have the time to study and describe the procedures relating to
cancellations.

	BATCHING.  Machines are installed about one month after the
date of order.  As soon as the order has been placed, and has been
through the Equipment Order Entry (EOE) process, the Order Package
containing the relevant documents is sent to the scheduler.  A Strip
Board, summarizing the details of each machine installation, is
maintained for quick reference, and the first operation is to prepare
a fresh strip for the new order.  Details of the supplies
to accompany the machine installation are sent to the
Regional Distribution Center (RDC), so that they can be delivered well
before the machine arrives.  Then the Order Package is filed in the
Open Order file.

	ALLOCATION.  Every week the scheduler receives from the Region
Headquarters a Weekly Allocation Sheet.  This sheet is received two
weeks in advance of the period to which it refers, and shows how many
machines of each type will be available to the Branch for installation
during the week in question.  The scheduler maintains an E_q_u_i_p_m_e_n_t_
C_o_n_t_r_o_l_ L_o_g_ (ECL), arranged by machine type, showing each installation
and its projected date.  The weekly Allocation sheet is used to add
new entries to this log.

	ROUGH SCHEDULING.  Every day the scheduler plans the
deliveries of machines for the corresponding day two weeks hence.  She
works through the Strip Board and the ECL, compiling a list of the
machines that can be installed that day.  The list of deliveries for
each day is entered on a form called the Pick-and-Pull (P&P).  This
form eventually generates the instructions to the rigger, the person
who actually delivers the machine.  A fresh Strip Board is prepared
containing all the strips for the day's deliveries.

	DETAILED SCHEDULING.  After making up the list of deliveries,
the scheduler goes through the Open Order file, pulling out the
relevant Order Packages, checking them and transfering them to a
separate Open Order file.

	REPORTING.  After all the day's scheduling is done, various
people must be notified.  Copies are made of the daily Strip Board, of
the Pick-and-Pull, and of the Work Orders that show details of each
order.  These are sent to the rigger and to certain managers., and are
also posted in several places in the Branch Office.  The Pick-and-Pull
is sent to the E_q_u_i_p_m_e_n_t_ _L_o_g_i_s_t_i_c_s_ _C_e_n_t_e_r_ (ELC), the warehouse from
which deliveries are made.

	AUDITING.  The scheduler receives a daily report from the
rigger, indicating the machines he has installed the previous day.
She checks this against the Pick-and-Pull, and then transfers the
appropriate strips to a new Strip Board showing those machines that
are Shipped/Not Installed (SNI).  Likewise, the Order Packages for
these installations are moved to a special Shipped/Not Installed Open
Order file.

	The Batching operation is the
only phase during scheduling that requires the service of a typist;
the actual typing is done by the Branch receptionist.

	1.  Order Packages are received one by one after they have
been through the EOE (Equipment Order Entry) process.  These packages,
each in a manila folder, include the COED (Customer Order Entry
Document), the service agreement and the purchase order made out by
the customer.  A batch of Order Packages is made up and given to the
receptionist.  

	2.  The receptionist types a strip for each order and places
the strip in the folder.

	3.  The batch of Order Packages returns to the scheduler.

	4.  The strip is removed and is inserted on the Strip Board
for the appropriate machine type (SB/MT).

	5.  The Order Package is stacked on one side for later filing.

	6.  The COED includes an Initial Supply Order (ISO), a list of
supplies to be provided when the machine is installed.  The
appropriate part of the COED is copies, and the copy is placed in a
batch of ISO's.  The COED number, a unique number stamped on each
blank COED form, is written on the batch cover sheet.  

	7.  The Order Packages are filed in the Open Order drawer, a
single file drawer.  The front part of this drawer is devoted to
unscheduled orders such as this one, and is subdivided by machine
type.  Behind are the Daily (OO/D) and Shipped/Not Installed (OO/SNI)
sections of the Open Order drawer.

	8.  At the end of the day, the ISO Batch is completed:  the
batch size is entered on the cover sheet, and a copy of the cover
sheet is made and filed.

	9.  The ISO Batch is mailed to the Regional Distribution
Center.

	Allocation is performed with the aid
of a Weekly Allocation Sheet received two weeks in advance from Region
Headquarters.  A typical such sheet shows
the weekly allocations for several other branches.  The scheduler uses
a felt pen to outline the column for the easier reference.

	The main purpose of Allocation is to open up fresh entries in
the E_q_u_i_p_m_e_n_t_ _C_o_n_t_r_o_l_ _L_o_g_ _(_E_C_L_)_.  Each page of the ECL is devoted to a
single type of machine;  each machine installation is given one line,
which will eventually show the serial number, COED number and customer
name.  At the time the weekly allocations are first
made, however, the serial numbers of the machines are not known, and
at this stage no attempt is made to assign names or COED numbers
either. 

	Later on, after the machines have been scheduled in detail, a
Monthly Allocation Report is received from the Region Headquarters:
this repeats the information given in the weekly allocations, and also
includes serial numbers.  It is used for checking purposes.

	10.  After studying the Weekly Allocation Sheet, the scheduler
selects each machine type in turn, and consults her Equipment Control
Log.

	11.  According to the number in the allocation, the
appropriate number of lines are opened up in the log, for filling in
later when daily scheduling is done.

	12.  The Weekly Allocation Sheet is filed.

	13.  Every month the scheduler receives the Monthly Allocation
Report.  The entries are compared, by serial number, with the
entries in the ECL. 

	14.  The Monthly Allocation Report is filed.

	It is during the first phase of daily scheduling
that orders are selected for installation on a day exactly
two weeks hence.  This operation involves a good deal of knowledge
about the installation operation - which Technical Representative can
install which type of machine, which machines are particularly
difficult and time-consuming to install, and so forth.  

	15.  A Pick-and Pull is prepared for the day's deliveries.
The scheduler fills in the control number (allocated sequentially),
the Branch number, the name of the rigger and the installation date. 

	16.  Taking the Strip Board for the machine type in question,
the scheduler selects the top most strip on the board and attempts to
schedule it.  Installations are never made until at least three weeks
have elapsed from placing the order;  therefore strips representing
orders less than a week old are not selected.

	17.  The scheduler consults the ECL to determine whether the
machine can be installed.

	18.  If the order can be scheduled, the customer name and COED
number are entered in the ECL.

	19.  The serial number and allocation week are copied from the
ECL to start a fresh entry on the Pick-and-Pull.

	20.  The COED number and customer name are entered from the
strip onto the Pick-and-Pull.  The first three digits of the serial
number are also entered, since these are invariant for any one machine
type.

	21.  The strip is transfered to a fresh Strip Board for the
day in question.

	22.  For each entry on the Strip Board, starting at the
bottom, the corresponding Order Package is retrieved from the Open
Order drawer:  the machine type identifies the folder in which to
look, and generally the package will be near the back of that section.

	23.  The Order Package is checked, and a copy is made of the
Work Order which consists of the top one-third of each side of the
COED;  the COED is designed so that it can be folded to present both
sections simultaneously to the copier.

	24.  The Order Package is placed on one side.

	25.  The Work Order copies are also placed on one side.

	26.  When the day's installations have been handled, the
packages are placed in a special section of the Open Order drawer,
devoted to that day' installations.

	The Pick-and-Pull is not used during the Detailed Scheduling
phase, but after the daily scheduling is complete it must be sent to
the Equipment Logistics Center.  The rigger also needs it, together
with copies of the Work Orders to tell him exactly where to install
each copier.  In addition, the scheduler posts copies of the Daily
Strip Boards for the benefit of Technical Representatives, and keeps
various members of the Branch management informed about installation
scheduling. 
	27.  Twelve copies are made of the daily Strip Board;  eight
of these are for inclusion in sets of documents sent to Branch
managers;  the remaining four are posted around the Branch Office.

	28.  The day's Work Orders are copied and made into batches
for distribution.

	29.  The Pick-and-Pull is telecopied to the ELC.

	30.  A copy is made for the rigger of the Pick-and-Pull, which
is then filed in a folder.

	31.  The copied documents are made up into batches, and
distributed.

	Auditing takes place on the day
following installation, when a report is received from the rigger
listing the machines he installed the previous day.  This report
provides, for the first time, the serial numbers of the machines
installed.  In this final stage of scheduling, the rigger's report is
checked against the Pick-and-Pull for the day, serial numbers are
copied into the ECL, any errors detected are resolved, and the orders
are tansfered from Daily to Shipped/Not Installed (SNI) status.  The
Rigger Report, includes other details besides impending deliveries,
but these do not relate to our study.  

	32.  The Rigger Report, received via Telecopier, is checked
against the Pick-and-Pull folder.  Entries are identified by COED
number.  Generally all the entries on the Rigger Report are to be
found on a single day's P&P, but rigger delays and coordination
problems may cause discrepancies, and the scheduler may have to go
back to the folder for ohther P&P's.

	33.  The COED number is also used to find the machine's entry
in the ECL.  The serial number is copied from the Rigger Report to the
ECL.

	34.  The customer name is copied from the P&P to the Rigger
Report entry.

	35.  Using the customer name as key, the scheduler finds the
corresponding strip on the Daily Strip Board and transfers it to the
SNI Strip Board.

	36.  Order Packages are Likewise located and transfered to the
SNI section of the Open Order drawer.

	37.  The scheduler goes to the terminal and enters the
`Equipment Received' data from the Rigger Report.

	38.  The Rigger Report is filed in a folder.

	Installation Scheduling is carried out almost entirely by one
person.  Schedulding involves both routine paper work and complex
decision-making, and exhibits an interesting interplay of logs, files
and strip boards.
