Dear Professor Smith:
.begin para
	I would like to nominate Kenneth Kahn for a Junior Fellowship at the University
of Michigan.  As Ken's thesis supervisor, I find that his research is very original and
creative.  He has an excellent record and has published several papers in the fields
of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Graphics.
.end
.begin para
	During his graduate study at MIT, he has worked with different research groups.  First
he worked with the Clinical Decision Making Group and did his Master Thesis with them on the
mechanization of temporal knowledge.  He then moved on the the Logo Group of the Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory where he taught elementary school children computer animation and
language processing.  He developed a computer language for that purpose which he has continued
to improve.  For the last two years he has been honored by holding an IBM graduate fellowship.
During this period he has been working on his doctoral thesis which is exploration of the
processes of creation as exemplified by a computer system that he created that is capable of
making animated films in response to a high level script.  He is expected to finish his
thesis by August 1978.
