TO:  Area II Committee
FROM:  Carl Hewitt
SUBJECT:  Area Examination for Robert Woodham
.end

.begin para
	The area examination for Robert Woodham was held on February 9, 1976.
The committee members were Professors Horn, Minsky, Ward, and Hewitt [Chairperson].
The committee examined Mr. Woodham in the general area of Artificial Intelligence
with special reference to common sense reasoning.
On the basis of a well written paper and good performance in answering questions,
the committee recommends that Mr. Woodham be deemed to have passed his
area examination.
.end
.begin para
	The examination began with a request for Mr. Woodham to describe the
general area of vision research with particular emphasis on applications.
Mr. Woodham gave a coherent discussion of the field.  He feels that
the main applications of vision in the next five years or so will
be in the areas of inspection and monitoring.
.end

.begin para
	The papers assigned for the exam within the topic of "Common Sense Reasoning"
were:
.skip
.begin narrow 12,0
.begin para
"Concepts for Representing Mundane Reality in Plans" by Abelson.
Representation and Understanding edited by Bobrow and Collins.
.end
.begin para
"Organization and Inference in a Frame-like System of Common Sense Knowledge" by Charniak.  Proceedings of Workshop on Theoretical Issues in Natural Language Processing.
10-13 June 1975.
.end
.begin para
"Scripts, Plans, and Knowledge" by Schank and Abelson
Proceedings of IJCAI-75.
.end
.begin para
"One System for two Tasks:  A Commonsense Algorithm Memory that Solves Problem and Comprehends Language" by Reiger.
A. I. Working Paper 114.
.end
.end
.skip
The committee felt that reading and criticizing the above four papers represented a
challenging task.  The critique produced by Mr. Woodham was very clear containing
detailed criticisms of some of the authors.
.end

.begin para
	The examination turned to an oral critique by Mr. Woodham of
the papers which he had been assigned to read.
Mr. Woodham began with an analysis of common sense reasoning which
is trivial and mundane knowledge about the world that people commonly
use in everyday activities.
He pointed out that all of the authors assume that they can analyze common
sense reasoning by analyzing the mechanisms needed to understand stories.
Professor Horn questioned whether this assumption was valid pointing out
that the authors had not analyzed spatial knowledge to any degree.
.end

.begin para
	Mr. Woodham then turned to the issues of representation, inference,
and control.  Representation concerns the issue of the use of primitives.
Inference concerns making explicit what was previously only implicit in the
the representation.  Control concerns issues of how to use available inference
mechanisms.
Professor Ward questioned whether there is any alternative to the use of
primitives.  Mr. Woodham clarified his remarks by noting that it is the
number and use of primitives that is at issue with some authors (notably Schank)
favoring a very small number whereas others (such as Charniak) permitting
large numbers.
Having only a small number of primitives seems to require that English
sentences must be expanded to the level of primitives in order to
be used.  Mr. Woodham gave the example of how the sentence
.begin outquote; narrow 12,12
John killed Mary for a reason.
.end
.skip
would be represented as a conceptual dependency graph whose meaning is equivalent to:

.begin outquote; narrow 12,12
John though something, which caused him to do something, which caused
Mary to become in a state of worst possible health.
.end
.skip
Professor Minsky suggested that perhaps Schank had recently withdrawn somewhat
from the above position on expanding everything in terms of a very few
primitives.
.end

.begin para
	Mr. Woodham then turned to the issue of canonical forms.  He maintained
that for English that it was not realistic to hope for canonical forms in a
representation in the sense that two English sentences would mean the same
if and only if they had the same representation.
Professor Ward raised the issue of canonical forms for lambda expressions
pointing out that normal forms are a canonical form in that if two forms
have the same normal form then they are equivalent.
Professor Minsky pointed out that the meaning of a sentence in English
is analogous to the function which
corresponds to a lambda expression.
There is no unique lambda expression that corresponds to a function
considered as a set of ordered pairs.
.end

.begin para
	Professor Hewitt asked the relationship between the plans
of high-level goal-oriented languages like PLANNER and the scripts
of Schank and Abelson.  Mr. Woodham pointed out that the scripts were not
just plans of how to carry some activity such as how to eat in
a restaurant.  Rather the scripts were directions on how to process
stories about people eating in restaurants.
.end

.begin para
	Professor Horn asked Mr. Woodham to rank the work represented
in the papers which he had read on a spectrum of development of
implementation on a scale from vague ideas to precise specified in terms
that would make implementation straight forward.  Mr. Woodham was
able to construct this spectrum and argue persuasively for
his ranking.
Professor Ward asked Mr. Woodham to elaborate on his criticism of Abelson.
Professor Hewitt asked him to relate Reiger's By-Passable Networks
to production systems.
Mr. Woodham was able to make the correspondence between production systems
and Reiger's networks and show how the by-pass mechanism corresponds to adding
more productions.
.end

.begin para
	The exam finished up with Mr. Woodham presenting an overview
of his proposed thesis topic which is an investigation into the
kinds of visual processing needed to detect flaws in castings.
