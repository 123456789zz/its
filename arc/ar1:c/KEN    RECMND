Dear Ms. Niemeyer:
.begin para
	I would like to strongly support
Kenneth Kahn for consideration as a Junior Fellow at the University
of Michigan.  As Ken's thesis supervisor, I find that his research is very original and
creative.  He has an excellent record and has published several papers in the fields
of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Graphics.
.end
.begin para
	During his graduate study at MIT, he has worked with different research groups.  First
he worked with the Clinical Decision Making Group and did his Master Thesis with them on the
mechanization of temporal knowledge.  This research has been published in the A.I. Journal
(co-authored by his supervisor)
and is considered to be a substantial contribution to the state of the art.
.end
.begin para
	He then moved on the the Logo Group of the Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory where he taught elementary school children computer animation and
language processing.  He developed an actor-based
computer language called DIRECTOR which he has continued
to improve.
He attended and has a paper in the proceedings of the Siggraph/ACM Workshop
on "User-oriented Design of Interactive Computer Graphics
Systems".  During this period he participated in a graduate experimental film
course, producing several films.  Byte magazine sponsored a Computer Art Contest
in which Ken was a first place winner and his entry is to appear on the cover of
the magazine.
Also he did an excellent job in teaching a section of our
undergraduate course on Artificial Intelligence Problem-Solving Paradigms.
.end
.begin para
	For the last two years he has been honored by holding an IBM graduate fellowship.
During this period he has been working on his doctoral thesis which is an exploration of the
processes of creativity as exemplified by a computer system that he is building
that is capable of
making animated films in response to a high level script.  He is expected to finish his
thesis by August 1978.
In the course of his thesis research he has improved the syntax, speed, and
cleanliness of DIRECTOR and added new capabilities since last spring.
In addition Technology Review has published his excellent survey of the
the field of computer animation (co-authored with Henry Lieberman).
.end

.begin para
	In terms of comparison with other students, Ken is our best graduate student
in the area of computer graphics and animation since Ron Baecker graduated in 1969.
In many respects Ken is already more mature and broadly based than Ron was at a similar
stage of his career.  Ron is currently a professor at the University of Toronto
directing their computer graphics research.
.end
.begin para
	In summary I believe that Ken has outstanding potential as a teacher and
research worker in computer science with a particularly strong background
in the areas of computer animation, artificial intelligence, and programming
languages.
