TO:  Area II Committee
FROM:  Carl Hewitt
SUBJECT:  Area Examination for Jon Doyle
.end

.begin para
	The area examination for Jon Doyle was held on November 30, 1977.
The committee members were Professors Goldstein, Martin, and Hewitt [Chairperson].
The committee examined Mr Doyle in the general area of representation of knowledge.
On the basis of good oral presentation and originality in his critique of
the papers,
the committee recommends that Mr. Doyle be deemed to have passed his
area examination.

Comparing the approaches used in the above represented a
challenging task.
Mr. Doyle demonstrated a good grasp of the of the strengths and
limitations of the various representation languages.
In fact his paper was considered sufficiently perceptive that
Professor Szolovits used it in his knowledge based engineering course.
