Dear Sir:

.begin para
	This letter is in support of the renewal of the IBM fellowship
for Kenneth Kahn.  It is intended to supplement the letter which I wrote
last year when Ken was first proposed for the fellowship.
.end
.begin para
	In the last year Ken has vigorously pursued his thesis research.
In the course of this research
he has developed a new approach to knowledge-based animation and a scenario
exemplifing it.  He has improved the syntax, speed, and cleanliness of his actor-based
animation language and added new capabilities since last Spring.
.end
.begin para
	Ken has written two publishable papers in the last year.
He attended and has a paper in the proceedings of the Siggraph/ACM
Workshop on "User-oriented design of Interactive Computer Graphics Systems".  He
has nearly completed an article reviewing the field of computer animation for
Technology Review.
.end
.begin para
	Last fall he participated in a graduate experimental film course, producing
several films.  This school year he is taking courses and reading the
relevant literature in Aesthetics and
Art History for his thesis project.
Ken was a place winner of Byte magazine's Computer Art Contest.  His entry will
appear on a cover of the magazine.
One
of his animated films is being shown in various film festivals, theatres and cable television.
.end
.begin para
	Last summer he worked on the problems of representing the specifications
and commentary of simple LISP
programs for data structures.  The purpose of the research was to explore how a system with
the specifications, commentary and their interconnections would be able to help a program
in modifying either the program or the specifications.
.end
.begin para
	In summary, the fellowship has enabled Ken to devote his entire energy to
the pursuit of his research free of other distracting responsibilities.
This freedom has resulted in his outstanding performance during the period
which he has held the fellowship.  If his fellowship is renewed, he will be able
to continue his thesis research developing a knowledge-based approach to
computer graphics.  
This is an area in which we currently do not have any research contracts which
could provide him with a assistanship.  Ken needs a fellowship if he is
to continue to devote his full time to making further progress in his doctoral
research.
