Dear Sirs:

Without qualifications I would recommend Michael Freiling for a position on your
faculty. In his years at our lab, he has performed research of top quality.
His research has concentrated on developing techniques for representing general
causal structures, and in applying these techniques to problems involving simple
machines.  
He has demonstrated a remarkable ability to plan and coordinate his own research
project.
	He is also quite friendly, diligent, and open minded. His ability to form
freindships and get along with others would make him a great asset to your
faculty.
