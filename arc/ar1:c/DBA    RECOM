Dear Ms. Bressey:
.sp
I consider Bruce Anderson to be eminently qualified for the
post of Lecturer in the Computing Center.
Bruce has a sharp mind, knows the literature of the field,
and expresses himself well.
From my visit to Essex last summer and from your description
of the post, I believe that Bruce would fit in well
with the research and teaching interests of the Computer
Science division.
.sp
I have known Bruce for over two years.
We first met at IJCAI-71 in London.
I got to know him better when I visited Edinburgh
after the conference.
Since that time our paths have crossed regularly
and we have had extensive discussions on developments in the field.
Bruce is one of the people
whose comments and criticisms I value most highly.
.sp
In summary I consider Bruce Anderson to be extremely
well qualified for the post of Lecturer in the Computing Center
and recommend that you appoint him.
