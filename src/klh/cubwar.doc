			CUBE WAR

	Cubewar is a computer game played on conventional terminals
between from two to eight players.  It has been transmitted through
the ARPANet from its originator, Jim Sulzen at UC-at-Irvine.
It is a highly interactive program,
which will be kept quite busy handling all of its
terminals.  Thus, it will often be a load on the system,
and a moderately used system may not be able to provide adequate
response to Cubewar.  According, it should be used during idle
time whenever possible.

	The game is played within a cube of space, from 6
to 8 cubes on a side.  Each player is a 'ship' in this cubical
space, provided with simple means of locating others, and armed
with a 'blazer' to attack other ships.  The cubes which make up
cubical space might be thought of as quarants in StarTrek, within
which a ship may have varying locations.  This is not the case.
A ship is either in one cube, or it is not; there are no variations
on the fact of being 'in' a particular cube.  

	A ship has a particular direction in which it is facing,
one direction which is directly in 'front' of the ship.
This is one of the six possible directions relative to the cube,
with no grades in between.  Consider a left-handed Cartesian
coordinate system.  The direction directly in front of you
is 'plus-X', while the opposite is 'minus-X.'  To your right
is the 'plus-Y' direction, to your left is 'minus-Y,'  upward is
'plus-Z' and downward is 'minus-Z.'  This is the system used in
defining Cubewar directions.  In addition, a cube has a three-digit
address, from (1,1,1) to (8,8,8) assuming a size-8 cube.

	In addition to a 'forward' direction, the ship has a definite
'upward' direction.  The two facings, forward and upward, are used
to specify what area of space is examined by the Radar commands.
The two facings, of course, will be 90 degrees apart.
You have six commands to alter the orientation of your ship:
Right Turn (RT), Left Turn (LT), UP, Down (DN), Rotate Right
(RR), and Rotate Left (RL).

	The ships have movement ability, through the Move (MV)
command.  This causes the ship to take one step in the 'forward'
direction.  There is no way to order the ship to 'keep moving,'
you must issue a MV for each step.  The ship will not be permited
to leave the cube; there is nowhere else to go.
	Radar: There are two commands available to let you see
what is outside of your ship.  These are Forward Radar and
Mobile Radar.  Both of these show you a grid of nine squares,
giving you the contents of nine cubes in space.  What is shown
is either an asterisk, a dash, or a number.  An asterisk indicates
that the cube section is outside the cube, and the dash indicates
that the cube section is empty.  A one-digit number indicates that the
cube section is occupied by a ship, and the number shows which
ship.  By this you may recognize you, your friends, and your enemies.

	The difference between the Forward and Mobile Radars is in
which cube sections are shown.  The simple one is the Forward radar.
It takes a parameter, entered like 'FR2', which gives the distance
between your ship and the start of the display.  For example,
a 'FR' command alone would produce something like

			- - -
			- 1 -
			- - -

which means that you (ship #1) have nothing around you.  With forward
radar the nine locations shown will be in the same 'plane' as your ship.
Consider your orientation, with a specific forward and upward direction.
Forward radar shows you what is in front of you or just on each side of
you, and never what is above or below you.  For reasonableness it will
also not show you what is behind you.  This means that the bottom line shown
is waste; you can make better use of the display by pushing the scan forward
a few cubes, like 'FR1', which might show

			- - 5
			- - -
			- 1 -

which shows your ship one step backwards.  It also shows ship #5 two
cubes ahead of you and one to the right. Recall the commands given
above.  Perform a RT, an MV, and a LT. Where are you now?
Another 'FR1' gives you
			- 5 -
			- - -
			- 1 -
so you are on the same plane, but one step to your right.
	You have on the front of your ship a Blazer which will project
directly in front of your ship until it hits something.  It will enter
each cube in front of you until it finds a ship, or the edge of the cube.
Since ship 5 is right in front of you, typing 'FB' will result in the 
message 'BLAZER HIT ON PHANTOM' or something like it.  This means that you
hit him.  It also tells you 'his' name, the name he typed what the game
started up.  Now if you FB again, if he hasn't moved yet, you will get
another similar message.  A ship can take two blazer hits.  The third
time it gets hit, it is 'destroyed', and disappears, with the message
'PLAYER PHANTOM KILLED BY NOVICE' sent to all the players.
(The name NOVICE was what ever you said you were.)  Your victim got
recreated someplace else in the cube.
	Mobile Radar:  This is rather more complicated than Forward
Radar.  This takes a three-digit number as parameter.  These numbers
give the location of a cube in space, with the given displacement
from your ship.  The first digit is the X-displacement, the second Y,
the last Z.  Thus, 'MR300' refers to the third cube in front of you.
What does it do with this cube?  It takes a cross-section of the
cube around that cube section, at right angles to the line between you
and that section.  That is, it shows what is above and below the given
cube section.  Consider the previous example with FR.  Given the situation

			- 5 -
			- - -
			- 1 -

the command 'MR200' will give the display

			- - -
			- 5 -
			- - -

which means that ship 5 is at range 2 (since MR200 found him) and
directly in front of you (which you knew).  Now do a DN (Down), Move,
and UP.  Consider where you are now.  FR finds nothing, since the
enemy is not on your plane, but on the one above you.  But 'MR200' gives

			- 5 -
			- - -
			- - -

which means that he is still 2 steps in front of you, but, as you see,
one level above you.  

	This permits you to examine much more space than FR permits.
You can use FR to look for ships to shoot at immediately.  Mobile
Radar will permit you to examine a whole 'tunnel' in front of you
to find someone who can't see you on Forward Radar.  To give him
a warning, whenever anybody is shown an a Mobile Radar scan be gets
the message '***BEING SCANNED' which gives him a chance to move.
	Scoring:  To give some way of comparing the performances of
the many players, points are scored for each player.  Two points are
scored for hitting somebody with a blazer, and ten for killing him.
The 'Name' command, NM, gives a display of the performances of all
the players. For instance,

			RATING	HITS	BLZRS	DEATHS
1) NOVICE		  16	 0	  13	   0
2) LORD BALTIMORE	  48	 1	  19	   0
3) AVENGER		   5	 2	   7	   1
4) PIMPERNEL		- 41	 0	   9	   3
5) PHANTOM		- 28	 0	   6	   2

Observe the Rating column.  Every time you get two points,
your opponent loses two points.  The hits column shows how many
hits the ship has taken, towards the limit of three.  The BLZRS
column shows how many Blazer fires the ship has left.  Each ship
starts with 3 times as many blazers as there are players, and
get 3 as a bonus whenever it kills another ship.  The Deaths column
shows how many times the player took his three hits and had to be 
recreated.
	EtCetera: The Message command permits you to send messages
to other players, or to all the players at once.  The formats are
	MS phant:got you!
or	MS *:everyone after number 5!

where the player's name is given followed by a colon and the message.
In some versions the first five letters of the name are required, 
in others the first three.  To send the message to everyone
the player name is given as an asterisk.

	The Trace command (TR) may be issued when you see somone
on the Mobile radar.  Thereafter, you can issue Print Trace (PT) and be
told where in space that ship has gone to.  It is given in cube-relative
locations, so you must know where you are to make use of the information.
The Facing command (FA) gives a display like
	+Z
	+X => (4,6,1)
which means that your ship is at X=4, Y=6, Z=1, and that +X is in
front of you and +Z is above you.

	Due to all sorts of reasons you may be disenchanted with the
name you gave when you started the game.  To change it type
	RNnewname
and it will be announced to everyone to keep things straight.

	The default Cube size is 6X6X6.  If there are 5 or more
players it goes up to 8X8X8, which is the absolute limit.
Should you wish to change the size, the player who started the game
can say
	CU 7
for instance, to change the size to 7X7X7.

	The game may be in progress when another player arrives.
Rather than restarting the game, the person who is running it can issue
	NP25newplayername
to define TTY25, for instance, to be player 'newplayername'.
If he doesn't like his name, after all, he can change it.
	CubeWar is started by a RUN CUBWAR[A630DK32].
Answer the question "How Many Players?" with the number 1 through 8,
no CR required.  Provide the TTY numbers as two digits each, no more
no less, no delimiters, no carriage return.  If it says you blew it,
and asks again, retype all the TTY numbers.  CUBWAR is maintained
and developed by Dave King, KING@CMUA or KING@CMUB.
